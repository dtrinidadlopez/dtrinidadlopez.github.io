 Hello Guys! My name is Danny Trinidad Lopez and this is my portfolio for my CSC106 course at the Unversity of Rhode <br>
        Island. To talk a little about what's the course about, it is a programming course  that does not go much in details of how to
        <br> code, but it defenitely tries to show the fun of it. In this portfolio, you will see how I build this website from scrap and <br> explain 
        to you my progress, some background about me and my JavaScripts that I created. Enjoy using the tabs! <br>
